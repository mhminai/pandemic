  abstract = {This book provides the most thorough view available on this new and intriguing dimension of workplace psychology, which is the basis of fulfilling, productive work. The book begins by defining work engagement, which has been described as 'an opposite to burnout,' following its development into a more complex concept with far reaching implications for work-life. The chapters discuss the sources of work engagement, emphasizing the importance of leadership, organizational structures, and human resource management as factors that may operate to either enhance or inhibit employee's experience of work. The book considers the implications of work engagement for both the individual employee and the organization as a whole. To address readers' practical questions, the book provides in-depth coverage of interventions that can enhance employees' work engagement and improve management techniques.  Based upon the most up-to-date research by the foremost experts in the world, this volume brings together the best knowledge available on work engagement, and will be of great use to academic researchers, upper level students of work and organizational psychology as well as management consultants.},
